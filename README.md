Hi! This is the code of the HackUPC landing page.

## Develop

Clone the repo, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and run `yarn install` the first time:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hackupc/hackupc-landing.git
cd hackupc-landing

npm install -g yarn

yarn install
```

Use `yarn start` to compile and serve the build directory in real-time. It reloads every time there's a change. Then view the website at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

```sh
yarn start
```

Whenever you want, fix auto-fixable lint errors and format files:

```sh
  yarn run lint:eslint
  yarn run lint:stylelint
  yarn run lint:prettier
```

From while to while, update the dependencies with this command:

```sh
  yarn upgrade-interactive
```

### Tips

- **Use `VS code`**, there's the `.vscode` folder with a good workspace configuration. It will be applied automatically.
- Install `ESlint` and `Prettier` extensions.

## Deploy

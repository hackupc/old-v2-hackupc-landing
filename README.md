Install
-------

First off, you need the `sass` ruby gem. You can install it with `sudo
gem install sass`. Make sure to have `gulp` and `bower` installed
globally. Then run:

	npm install
	bower install
	gulp

Develop
-------

Use `gulp watch` to compile the dist directory in real time.

Remember to save all new dependencies with `--dev`.

Deploy
------

Statically serve the `dist/` directory.

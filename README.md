Hi! This is the code of the HackUPC landing page.

## Develop

Clone the repo, install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with nvm, and install the dependencies with npm the **first time**:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hackupc/hackupc-landing.git
cd hackupc-landing

# Install nvm 
# Copy the command from here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

nvm install
nvm use

npm install
```

Use `npm run start` to compile and serve the build directory in real-time. It reloads every time there's a change. Then view the website at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

```sh
npm run start
```

Whenever you want, fix auto-fixable lint errors and format files:

```sh
  npm run lint:eslint
  npm run lint:stylelint
  npm run lint:prettier
```

### Tips

- **Use `VS code`**, there's the `.vscode` folder with a good workspace configuration. It will be applied automatically.
- Install `ESlint` and `Prettier` extensions.

## Deploy

**Push to master**. [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hackupc) will build and deploy automatically.

If you push something that doesn't build, don't worry, it won't be published.
